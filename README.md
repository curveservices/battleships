## Overview

[Project]() has been set as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Project: Battleship. A classic game of Battleships using Jest TDD

## Assets

- [Battle ship rules](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>)
- [Play here](http://en.battleship-game.org/)

## Obejective

1. Begin by creating the Ship class/factory.

- â€˜shipsâ€™ will be objects that include their length, the number of times theyâ€™ve been hit and whether or not theyâ€™ve been sunk.
- test your objectâ€™s public interface. Only methods or properties that are used outside of â€˜shipâ€™ object need unit tests.
- Ships should have a hit() function that increases the number of â€˜hitsâ€™ in your ship.
- isSunk() should be a function that calculates whether a ship is considered sunk based on its length and the number of hits it has received.

2. Create Gameboard class/factory.

- run tests to see that code is coming together. DO not create a UI at first so no DOM methods or console.log
- Gameboard should be able to place ships at specific coordinates by calling the ship factory function.
- Gameboard should have a receiveAttack function that takes a pair of coordinates, determines whether or not the attack hit a ship and then sends the â€˜hitâ€™ function to the correct ship, or records the coordinates of the missed shot.
- Gameboards should keep track of missed attacks so they can display them properly.
- Gameboards should be able to report whether or not all of their ships have been sunk.

3. Create Player.

- Players can take turns playing the game by attacking the enemy Gameboard.
- The game is played against the computer, so make the â€˜computerâ€™ capable of making random plays. The AI does not have to be smart, but it should know whether or not a given move is legal (i.e. it shouldnâ€™t shoot the same coordinate twice).

4. Create the main game loop and a module for DOM interaction.

- At this point it is appropriate to begin crafting your User Interface.
- The game loop should set up a new game by creating Players and Gameboards. For now just populate each Gameboard with predetermined coordinates. You can implement a system for allowing players to place their ships later.
- Weâ€™ll leave the HTML implementation up to you for now, but you should display both the playerâ€™s boards and render them using information from the Gameboard class/factory.
  You need methods to render the gameboards and to take user input for attacking. For attacks, let the user click on a coordinate in the enemy Gameboard.
- The game loop should step through the game turn by turn using only methods from other objects. If at any point you are tempted to write a new function inside the game loop, step back and figure out which class or module that function should belong to.
- Create conditions so that the game ends once one playerâ€™s ships have all been sunk. This function is appropriate for the Game module.

5. Finish it up

- There are several options available for letting users place their ships. You can let them type coordinates for each ship, or investigate implementing drag and drop.
- You can polish the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a â€˜hitâ€™.
- Optionally, create a 2 player option that lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth. If youâ€™re going to go this route, make sure the game is playable on a mobile screen and implement a â€˜pass deviceâ€™ screen so that players donâ€™t see each others boards!
